Mempin is a location-based “digital memories” platform where users drop pins on a map and attach photos, notes, stories, or full journeys to those places. Other users can unlock these memories through rules you set — location, passcodes, following, or always-unlocked — making it a mix of personal diary, travel log, and social discovery. The core idea is simple: capture moments tied to real-world locations, organise them into journeys, and let people explore or unlock them in a controlled, engaging way.

Still deciding whether do add or not:
-> ingocnito/anonymous mode ofr users -> all their pins etc. is anonymous, profile cant be clicked,  essentially no social aspect.
-> add payment systems basic/plus/premium
